  * Refactored `Mango::Application` to utilize `Mango::ContentPage`.  Now views have access to a `@content_page` instance variable.
  * Added `Mango::FlavoredMarkdown`, a subset of [GithubFlavoredMarkdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), into the Markdown-to-HTML conversion.

### Dependencies:

Please see {file:doc/HISTORY.mdown} for the historical overview of the project.

SYNOPSIS
--------

**Mango is a dynamic website engine for Ruby hackers who believe in minimalism.**

Mango let's you publish to the web using the tools you're already familiar with -- the file system and your trusty text editor.  With Mango, there is:

  * No clunky administrator interface for managing content
  * No database to install, configure, and manage

**The objective of Mango is to share 1 project -- 1 set of files -- between a small team of designers, developers, and content writers.**

FEATURES
--------

  * Mango tries to route HTTP requests to static files first
  * Then it tries to route HTTP requests to Markdown or Haml content pages or Sass style templates
  * Finally, it routes unknown HTTP requests to a customizable 404 page
  * Wraps content pages within a customizable Haml template and layout
  * Supports any Rack-based application server (e.g. Phusion Passenger, thin, mongrel, webrick, etc.)

REPORTING ISSUES
----------------

Is Mango not behaving like you expect it should?  Please forgive me!  Would you take a moment to shed light on my negligence over at the [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/ryansobol/mango/issues)?  Here's a **Pro Tip** -- you can read through existing issues and vote for which issues you'd like to see resolved first!

Thank you for taking the time to help improve Mango.

CONTRIBUTING
------------

Is Mango not behaving like you need?  Open-source to the rescue!  There is a plethora of documentation to bring a Rubyist of any level up to speed.  The API documentation is generated, once the dependencies are met (please see the REQUIREMENTS section), by issuing the follow command:

    $ rake yard

Patches are always welcome and appreciated!  The process is straight-forward for contributing your work back to the source:

* Fork the project -- may I suggest [Github](http://www.github.com)?
* Make your feature addition or bug fix **with specifications**.  It's important that I don't break your hard work in a future version unintentionally.
* Please do not casually alter files in the project root. (e.g. LICENSE, Rakefile, README.mdown, VERSION, etc.)
* Commit your changes and publish the change-set.
* Send me a pull request.  Remember, all specs must pass!

Before making your change, take a moment to get a feel for the style of coding, specifications, and in-line documentation.

Please see {file:doc/ROAD-MAP.mdown} to learn how to flow with the project.  In the near future, I plan on pushing this content directly into the [Issue Tracker](http://github.com/ryansobol/mango/issues).

Again, thank you for taking the time to help improve Mango.
